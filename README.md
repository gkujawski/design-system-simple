# 🧩 Design System Simple

## Purpose

This repository houses a foundational design system, providing a collection of reusable UI components and design tokens to ensure consistency and efficiency across various projects. It aims to streamline development by offering pre-built, accessible, and customizable elements.

## Background

This project was inspired by a technique for incorporating AI into design, demonstrated by Guilherme Gonzalez in Product Guru's. In his demonstration, Guilherme showed how he used AI to create a design system from scratch in just five days, emphasizing treating AI as a collaborator. He detailed his refined approach, starting with a single reusable button and providing specific premises for its variations and tokenization. He also explained how he used an existing Figma design system (Untitled UI) and the "Variables to JSON" plugin to export design variables into a JSON format, which was then fed to the AI.

Our process similarly leveraged the Simple Design System in Figma as a reference, instead of Untitled UI. We exported the tokens using the variables2json plugin to obtain the base JSON. Then, we attached this file to [v0](https://v0.dev/chat/update-design-tokens-rYgkdBSIfGi) and wrote the following prompt:

```
Use this JSON to update all components and design tokens. I also need you to distribute the component files into specific directories, in a structure that will be used in Storybook (e.g., /src/components). Important: remember that Storybook uses "stories" to showcase the components in different states. You'll need to create .stories.js, .stories.jsx, .stories.ts, or .stories.tsx files alongside your component files.
```

After six debug builds, we achieved the desired structure. Final dependency fixes were made with a few vibe coding sessions in the Gemini CLI. This way, it is ready to be worked on and polished in the Storybook, a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. It helps designers develop and share hard-to-reach states and edge cases without needing to run the whole app.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to separate concerns and facilitate easy navigation:

```

## Available Components

This design system currently includes (e.g.) a `Card` component, demonstrating basic usage and styling. More components will be added over time.

*   **Card:** A flexible container for grouping related content, supporting various visual styles and interactive states.

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are managed primarily through `src/tokens.ts` for direct usage in components and integrated with `tailwind.config.ts` for utility-first styling.

*   e.g. **Typography:** Defined in `src/tokens.ts` for consistent text styles (e.g., `heading`, `bodyBase`).
